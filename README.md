# README

This repository holds the data files and code to recreate analyses for the manuscript, "Extreme storm-induced run-off causes rapid, context-dependent shifts in nearshore subtropical bacterial communities," which is available on biorxiv: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/801886v1.

The code for the main analyses is available as an Rmarkdown file: 16S_Storms_and_RedSoil.Rmd

The same file is also available as an interactive .html: https://maggimars.github.io/RedSoil/16S_Storms_and_RedSoil.html

A subset of the data for this project was also used in a tutorial for amplicon data analysis: https://maggimars.github.io/RedSoil/AmpliconDataLesson.html
